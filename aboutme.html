			<h2>About Me in General</h2>
				<p>Born in Poland, I have lived in the US for the last fourteen years (from the Midwest, through the Northeast, to the Southeast). Originally a researcher in the field of neuroscience I have worked as a visual designer for several years, and have most recently been focusing on UX and UI design.</p>
				<p>Meaningful contribution to the community both locally and globally is a major motivator for my endeavors. In order to make those contributions successfully, I strive for excellence as a professional and as a human being.</p>

			<h2>Where I Live and What I do</h2>
				<p>I currently live in North Carolina, but I always think fondly of my Polish hometown, Cracow.</p>
				<p>I am thrilled to be part of an exciting research team at NC State University in Raleigh where I serve as a visual/UX/Ui designer. We design and develop diagnostic/assessment tools for middle school math learning.</p>
